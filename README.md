# Attributes Affect Car Insurance Waive using SAS

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of customers waiving car insurance â€” a critical metric for insurance companies to manage risk and retain clients. We use an XGBoost classifier, a powerful machine learning algorithm, to analyze key attributes influencing customer decisions.

## Data Description
The dataset used in this project contains various customer attributes, such as age, vehicle ownership, driving experience, past Duis, and credit score, along with a target variable indicating whether the customer waived their car insurance policy.

## Repository Contents
- `train.csv`: Training dataset containing customer attributes and the target variable.
- `car_insurance_prediction.ipynb: Jupyter notebook with the analysis and model training.
- submission.csv: Predictions for the test dataset.
- README.md: Documentation of the project.

## Key Steps
1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and encoding of the data, making it suitable for model training.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing the data to understand patterns and relationships, such as the impact of driving experience and credit score on waivers.
3. Feature Engineering: Selecting and transforming features for model training, such as categorizing credit scores or vehicle types.
4. Model Training: Building and training an XGBoost classifier.
5. Model Evaluation: Evaluating the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
6. Feature Importance Analysis: Understanding which features are most impactful in predicting insurance waivers.
7. Predictions: Generating churn predictions on the test dataset.
## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizations
- Scikit-learn for data preprocessing and model evaluation
- XGBoost for the prediction model
